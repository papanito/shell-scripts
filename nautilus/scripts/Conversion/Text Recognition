# Text Recognition Ver. 1.1
# Now using the tesseract engine by default!
# An OCR, Optical Character Recognition, gui application and cli script
# This script will convert almost any image of text (except pdf's)*1 into editable text.
#
# For OCR'ing, the preferred formats are of the tiff or pnm class: .tiff .tif .pnm .pbm .pgm .ppm
# Compatible formats are: .jpg .jpeg .gif .png .bmp .xcf .pct .pict
#
# These recognition engines have a very high character recognition success rate compared to other OCR's, including proprietary software.
#
# REM: The better/cleaner/higher contrasted/higher resolution your image/scan is the better the results
# 
# Dependencies: requires libtiff-dev (or -devel), tesseract-2.04 (latest stable-version), your chosen language data for Tesseract (2.00 and up) *2,
# ImageMagick, zenity, and OpenOffice or other text editor *3
# This version of tesseract can be downloaded from here: http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/downloads/list
# Warning: This script will not work with the latest beta version (tesseract 3.00 pre-release) due to database structure modifications. 
# 
# Optional dependencies: ocrad ->an alternate recognition engine | if the inital results are unsatisfactory, maybe this engine will do better
# The latest version of ocrad can be downloaded off the GNU mirror list here: http://www.gnu.org/software/ocrad/
# 
# Also: Make sure to select Unicode UTF-8 in OpenOffice's pop-up window (or text editor of your choice). 
# 
#
#
# *1 	To extract text from PDF's use this online app: http://www.pdfescape.com/pdf/account/
# *2 	Install Tesseract first. Then extract all the language databases you need into the "wherever_you_installed/tesseract-2.04/tessdata" directory.
# 		This is done automatically if you extract the language databases from WITHIN the "tesseract-2.04" directory (and allow overwriting).
# 		This script allows the use of multiple language databases. Default is English and French. For adding others see comments below.
#		You NEED at least one language database or tesseract will not work.
# *3 	Simply change the occurance of "soffice -writer" below to a text editor of your choice, ie: gedit, KWrite, etc 
# 		Some systems call on OpenOffice Writer differently. If unsure, check the properties tab of your Writer launcher.
# 		Ie: On customized versions of OOo (such as the ones provided by Linux Mandrake or Gentoo), you start Writer with: oowriter 
#
#
# Troubleshooting:
#		If this script ends saying your text editor can't open "OCR output-editable text.txt", 
#		or if run off the cli: Unable to load unicharset file /usr/local/share/tessdata/eng.unicharset 
#		do (as superuser):
#		echo /usr/local/share /usr/share | xargs -n 1 cp -R wherever_you_installed/tesseract-2.04/tessdata 
#			Explanation: 	Tesseract may call on the tessdata directory from the /share directory of your filesystem, 
#							so you need to make your language databases available from there.
#

# First we make sure something's selected.
