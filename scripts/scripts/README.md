# shell scripts

## backup_simple.sh

A simple backup script to save essential configurations and data as tar file. The tar files are stored in a subdirectory in form of "YYYYMMDD" of a pre-configured backup directory.

## diskperformance.sh

A simple script to measure disk performance. The script uses `dd` to write a file n times whereas n can be specified as a parameter - default is 10. The output will be shown on the command line as well as in the logfile "diskperformance.log" which is in the same directory as the file written by `dd`.
Target directory should be specified as argument - if not `/root/` will be used so ensure you have access to it.

NOTE: this is currently only a simple test with permanent writing i.e. no random writing or reading. Therefore script needs to be extended accordingly
Examples:
